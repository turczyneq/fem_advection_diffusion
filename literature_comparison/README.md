(\Phi - efective flux, a - radius of particle, U - velocity, D - difusive constant, k = \Phi / (4 \pi a^2) - transfer coeficient, b is absorptive radius)
Definitions of peclet and sherwood in following publications were as follows:

 - Our definitions: Pe = (a+b)U/D;  Sh = \Phi / (4 \pi D (a+b))
 - Clift: Pe = (2aU/D); Sh = 2ak/D = \Phi / (2 \pi D a) 
 - Friedlander: no explicite definition of Pe and Sh basing on asymptotics presented Pe = (2aU/D); Sh =  \Phi / (2 \pi D a)
 - Westberg: Pe = (2aU/D); Sh = 2ak/D = \Phi / (2 \pi D a) 
 - Kutateladze: Pe = (2aU/D); Sh = 2ak/D = \Phi / (2 \pi D a) 
 - Feng: (WITHOUT 2) Pe = (aU/D); Sh =  \Phi / (2 \pi D a)
 - Kramers: Pe = (2aU/D); Sh = 2ak/D = \Phi / (2 \pi D a)
